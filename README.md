## My Philosophy

Here are some of my guiding principles when it comes getting things done:

- There are three states of being: Not knowing, action, and completion.
- Accept that everything is a draft. It helps to get it done.
- Pretend you know what you're doing, even if you don't, and just do it.
- Banish procrastination. If you wait more than a week to get an idea done, abandon it.
- The point of being done is not to finish but to get other things done.
- Laugh at perfection. It's boring and keeps you from being done.
- People without dirty hands are wrong. Doing something makes you right.
- Failure counts as done. So do mistakes.
- Destruction is a variant of done.
- If you have an idea and publish it on the internet, that counts as a ghost of done.
- Done is the engine of more.

Let's connect and collaborate on some amazing projects together! ðŸš€
